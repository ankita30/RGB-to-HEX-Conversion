# RGB-to-HEX-Conversion
In this project, we'll use Bitwise operators to build a calculator that can convert RGB values to Hexadecimal (hex) values, and vice-versa.  
We'll add three methods to the project:  
1. A method to convert RGB to Hex 
2. A method to convert Hex to RGB 
3. A method that starts the prompt cycle 

The program should do the following:  
1. Prompt the user for the type of conversion they want.
2. Ask the user to input the RGB or Hex value 
3. Use Bitwise operators and shifting in order to convert the value 
4. Print the converted value to the user
